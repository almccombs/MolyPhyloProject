Your project looks very interesting.
I think your methods section was easy to follow and understand.
I would appreciate some more background for the subpopulations you're focusing on.
some people might not know what "sink populations" mean so maybe explain that? you obviously don't have to haha.
Since this is just a draft, I'm sure you'll add it later but I still want to remind that a nice and concise legend for your figures/trees would've been super helpful to me.
I am not familiar with the distance measures you've used sadly but your explanation in the introduction part definitely helped.
